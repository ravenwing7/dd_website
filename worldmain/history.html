			<h2>The Stolen Lands: History</h2>
			<p>The history of this section of the realm is barely recorded. Even the name is temporary and unofficial,
			stemming from the fact that its dominion is constantly changing hands, between remote nobles, bandits, and
			primitive tribes. Civilization only entered the area within the past 50 years. Prior to that, even the local
			human bandits were scarce; fugitives on the run from authorities.</p>
			<p>The future is a promise of hardship for all inhabitants. With frequent skirmishes between opposing factions,
			it is clear that war is on the horizon.</p>
