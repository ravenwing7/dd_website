			<h2>The Stolen Lands: Demographics</h2>
			<p>With little explored of this land, there is even less known of what native peoples live here. Beyond the
			human settlers, there is so far very little to speak of civilization.</p>
			<p>Some primitive, mostly tribal races have been discovered here, however. Mostly vermin, it seems. Reptilian
			kobolds harrass the locals, although they are little more than an annoyance. With them, peace may be possible,
			with mutual respect of territory.</p>
			<p>Even less desirable are the reports of mites; filthy, hideous pests who thrive on filling the lives of all
			those around them with grief. They are at war with the kobolds.</p>
			<p>There are no official reports of other races. Yet, there is evidence of other peoples, within the deep caves,
			thick forests, and even the depths of the larger lakes.</p>
