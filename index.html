				<h1>Welcome</h1>
				<p>This page is dedicated to a Pathfinder campaign being played by a group of friends. It's mainly for our 
				use, so that we can have a knowledge compendium about our characters and the world they inhabit, as well 
				as our adventure thus far. However, I like to think even people who aren't directly involved in this campaign
				can get some enjoyment out of it as well.</p>
				
				<h1>What is Pathfinder?</h1>
				<p>If you've ever played or heard of Dungeons &amp Dragons, you effectively know what Pathfinder is. It's a
				role-playing game played with other people, using pencils and paper, dice, and imagination. More information
				about it and games like it can be found in the links tab.</p>
