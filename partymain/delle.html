			<h2>Delle</h2>
			<label>Player: Becky</label><br/>
			<label>Sex: Female</label><br/>

			<p>Delle is an impulsive free spirit. A born outlaw, she has managed to stay out of trouble her whole life
			largely by a mix of cunning skill and sheer luck. She is accomplished at archery and swordsmanship, and her
			talent for sleight of hand is unparalleled. However, her flighty thoughts keep her from sustaining long-term
			goals, and her companions must often work to keep her focused on the task at hand.</p>
