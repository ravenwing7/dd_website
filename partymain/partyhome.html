			<h1>Adventurers for Hire</h1>
			<p>We have banded together, a motley group of adventurers, each with his or her own purpose for traveling. 
			Though our reasons and mannerisms differ, each among us is generally good-natured, and our goals align with one
			another for the common good.</p>
			
			<h1>The Quest</h1>
			<p>There was not much fate that brought us together. We traveled together in a caravan of traders and met along
			the way. We each had our own reasons for being there, but we all sought adventure. Our destination reached, we
			gathered in the most likely place to find that adventure -- a local tavern. Little more than small errands to be
			found, our humble beginnings cannot determine the possibilities the future holds.</p>
