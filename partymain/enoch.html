			<p>Enoch, a monk of the Talionis Monastery, began his journey as a pilgrimage to grow in discipline, specifically
			to further tame his temper as a part of his training. Although usually mild-mannered, he is prone to fits of rage
			in tense situations; a quality for which he has been frequently admonished by his superiors.</p>
