				<h1>The Story So Far...</h1>
				<h2 id="ch1">Chapter 1</h2>
				<p>Our adventure begins as our party, Scanlan, Enoch, Estelle, Delle, and Dominus, arrives at a trading post run 
				by a man named Oleg. On arrival, we investigate a job board with several errands posted, during which we 
				encounter a local man named Isenhart, who offers to help us. On inquiry of Oleg, we learn of a group of bandits
				that demands periodic tribute of the post, and he hints that if we're looking for well-paid work, that's the
				place to start. We decide to wait to ambush the next group that comes to collect.</p>
				<p>A group arrives that very evening. After a brief encounter with several poorly trained thugs, we emerge
				victorious, capturing two after killing the rest. After dividing up the spoils, including enough horses for each
				of us, Scanlan interrogates the prisoners to find information about their lair. We then take to the tavern to 
				drink and plan. However, restless and drunk, Estelle saunters away to brutally execute the prisoners when no
				one is looking. With nothing to be done about drunken indiscretions regarding doomed criminals, we rest until
				morning.</p>
				<p>First thing in the morning, we leave to seek the bandit lair. After a couple of uneventful days' travel, we
				encounter a group a kobolds, a primitive reptilian race viewed by many as pests. The only one able to communicate
				in their language, Scanlan asks them about the bandits. We learn that there is a group at a watchtower in a 
				nearby forest clearing. We make haste in the direction set by the kobolds, and before long we arrive. Unable to
				maintain the element of surprise this time, we have a violent exchange but still emerge victorious, after
				Dominus rends their leader apart with his claws. Exhausted, we make camp and rest for the evening.</p>
